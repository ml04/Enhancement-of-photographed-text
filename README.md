# Enhancement-of-photographed-text
Python project concerning image processing

Uses Numpy and OpenCV to 
-load image, 
-blur the image, 
-detect edges, 
-detect 4-point contours
-rotates perspective
-applies threshold

Not a very ambitious project, but for purpose of having something written in Python on GitHub.

Runs from command prompt (terminal for Linux) with command: "python img_text.py"
